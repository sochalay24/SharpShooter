2.
1.INT. DARK ROOM. NIGHT.                                  1
CU. A boy is staring right into the camera. He has no
emotions on his face. Everything in the background is in
darkness. Only his face is lit with a warm white light.
BEAT.
The boy looks down to his palms. The camera whips to the
palms, which are red with blood. The blood keeps on dripping
from his hands. The camera whips tho his face again and HE
IS ABOUT TO SCREAM-
MATCH CUT TO:
1A.EXT. EMPTY OPEN GROUND. DAY.                           1A
The boy is now in the same position as he was before, but
now he is extra lit by the sun. He is alone in the area. He
looks at his hands again, to see a razor in his hand. The
blood has vanished. Suddenly he has a beard.
He stares at a figure very distant from him. He cannot make
out who it is. He squints to see who it is.
POV of boy: a lady dressed totally in black appears. It is a
small figure.
CUT TO:
Her hands are bloody now. she has a razor in her hand too.
the boy stares into the camera again, but this time the
beard is half. He looks down again, and his hands have blood
on them. The camera whips at his face, and all the beard has
vanished. HE IS ABOUT TO SCREAM AGAIN-
CUT TO:
1B.INT. DARK HALLWAY. NIGHT.                             1B
The boy is at the very end of the hallway, with nothing in
his hands.
CU. The boy is about to cry. A BEEP IS HEARD IN THE
BACKGROUND. The beat becomes louder and louder. It starts to
echo and the boy begins to close his eyes as if he is about
to die-
CUT TO BLACK:
3.
THE BEEPING STOPS.
2.INT. PSY ROOM. DAY.                                     2
Clock ticking. Constant clock ticking. Two people, the same
boy and probably a psychiatrist(mid 20s) from the
arrangement of the room are sitting in front of each other,
not talking.
 We see various things kept in the room after the master
shot. The boy is sitting there on the sofa, with the
psychiatrist opposite to him. No one is speaking. The
ticking intensifies before it reduces. Finally KARAN (18), a
patient who doesn't really want to be there, speaks.
KARAN
Kya?
DR. ANJALI
...
KARAN
Me sach bol raha hu, aur phirse bol
raha hu. Mujhe ye sabki zarurat
nahi hai.
Dr doesnt speak. She stares at him without blinking or even
moving.
KARAN
Kya???!
DR. ANJALI
(shrugging shoulders after a pause)
KARAN
mujhe nahi comfortable ye... ye sab
compulsory hai kya?
DR. ANJALI
Karan. I know you are facing
issues. I can't help you if you
don't want to accept that.
KARAN
Kuch bhi bolna hai matlab bolna hai
na...
DR. ANJALI
Me kuch bhi bol rahi hu?
4.
KARAN
Ha.
DR. ANJALI
Well jo reports me likha hai, me
tho bas usi basis pe bol rahi hu.
KARAN
Wo koi bhi doctor aisa koi bhi
report de deta. Usme kya hai.
DR. ANJALI
Why don't you want to accept the
fact ki you are suffring from panic
disorders?
KARAN
Depression wagera kuch nahi hai
mereko. Maasi bahut protective hai
mere maamle me. Din me 3 baar hagne
gaya tho bhi maasi ko tension aa
jaata hai. Mujhse se zyaada unko
zarurat hai ye sab ki.
DR. ANJALI
So you accept tumhe zarurat hai...
KARAN
Pch... aap bhaavna samjho na.
DR. ANJALI
Wahi tho kaam hai mera Karan. I
need you to be free and tell me
what is exactly the issue you are
facing.
KARAN
Issues nahi hain wo... normal baato
ke issues banaye gaye hain.
DR. ANJALI
Getting images and glimpses of dead
people is not normal.
KARAN
Yaad nahi aa sakti?
DR. ANJALI
Aa sakti hai, but that imaging is
harming you. Mentally bhi,
physically bhi.
Karan doesn't speak this time.
5.
DR. ANJALI
I know you for a long time. I know
when you need help.
KARAN
Mujhe sachme baat nahi karni. Aisa
force karke kuch nahi bolne waala
me.
DR. ANJALI
...
KARAN
KYA?
DR. ANJALI
Ok how about this. Tumhari maasi ne
paise pehle se hi bhar diye hain.
Now i cant give the money back, and
u cant leave this room bcz well
mujhe pata hai you won't. Toh aise
hi shaanti me baith sakte hain, or
you could tell me about what you
are going through, and get your
money's worth. How does this sound?
Karan doesnt speak for a while, stares around the room
looking at stuff and then finally starts talking.
KARAN
Theek hai. Kya bolu me?
DR. ANJALI
Tell me what had happened in that
party.
KARAN
party se pehle background dena
padega.
DR. ANJALI
Then tell me from wherever you want
to.
Karan becomes calm, stares towards the doctor, takes a deep
breath, pauses for a while before starting to talk, and
finally starts talking.
HOLD on Karan's face.

Continued conversation:
KARAN
Aryan pehle se har ek cheez ko kis
tarah barbaad karna hai, usme pro
hai.
DR. ANJALI

KARAN
Yes Aryan Banerjee.
DR. ANJALI
You did speak about him a lot when
we used to talk about your mother.
KARAN

DR. ANJALI
Sure sure. Continue.

Tracking shot of Karan walking. He sees from a distance,
ARYAN BANERJEE(18), sitting on a bike with his back towards
Karan, doing some stuff.
KARAN
(sneakily) (screams)
ARYAN
(Screams and is frightened) ISKI
MAA KA JESUS!
KARAN

ARYAN

KARAN
Arre nahi re. Mujhe bas dikha tu

ARYAN
Tere se kuch matlab nahi hai.
KARAN
Arre bata na.
ARYAN
Chup re dimaag mat kha mera. Kaam
karra karne de.
KARAN
Tu ja birthday theek se plan kar

Aryan is slightly shocked and sad that Karan guessed the
thing that he was doing.
ARYAN
Kuch bhi. Mereko kya aur kuch nahi
hai kya karne ko?
KARAN
Theek hai theek hai. Me bas guess
kiya bcz tu mujhe abhi 5 minute
pehle mere surprise party ka
invitation bheja hai.
ARYAN
Abbbbeee yaaar! Shi. Mereko laga hi
tha ki saala sab achhe se nahi hone
waala. Kuch na kuch raade hone hi
mangte na.
KARAN
Arre theek hai re...chalta hai.
Waise bhi i am just happy to know
ki tum sabko yaad hai.
ARYAN
Yaad kayko nahi rahega? Achha wo
chhod, but tereko malum kya ki me
literally aisa baap plan banaya hai
na, tu yeda hone waala.
KARAN
Achha? Bata phir, kya plan hai.
8.
ARYAN
Ha yahi baaki reh gaya tha na.
Saala ek cheez haga matlab har
cheez tereko nahi bolne wala me.
Kuch toh wo surprise element rehne
de.
KARAN
Theek hai theek hai. Mat bata. But
tu kuch problem toh nahi karne
waala na?
ARYAN
Ha matlab kasht leke sab karo bhi,
aur phir gaali bhi khao ki achhe se
kiya hai ya nahi. Ja me nahi karra
ab kuch.
KARAN
Arre arre tu chidh gaya. Me bolra
kyuki teri aadat hai. Tu excitement
me aake aisa literally basic cheeze
bhul jaata hai. Phir aisa problem
create ho jaata.
Aryan stares at Karan, a bit hurt about what KARAN just
said.
KARAN
(cont.) but uska ye
meaning nahi ki iss baar
bhi karega.
(BEAT)
Arre sorry baba. Jo karega sab
achha hi karega. Hai bharosa
tujhpe.

CUT TO: ARYAN ON PHONE
5.INT. OPEN AREA 1. 5 PM.                                 5

KARAN
Achha ho gaya hai sab?!
ARYAN
Nahi na bro...
11.
KARAN

ARYAN
Arre apne ko jana hai. Bas tu aake

KARAN

KARAN

ARYAN
Tereko kya ready hone ka zarurat?
Tu hai hi jalpari type sexy.
KARAN
Had saale, aata me ruk.
6.INT. HIS HOUSE. EVENING                                  6
The scene cuts to Karan getting ready for the party (match
cut) accompanied with rock music.
5A.INT. OPEN AREA 1. 5:30.                                5A
 He then picks up aryan, they travel and finally reach the
house.
2D.INT. PSY ROOM. DAY                                     2D
DR. ANJALI
So you reach the house.
KARAN
Yes.
Karan stops talking for a while.
DR. ANJALI
And...?
KARAN
Ha wo dramatization ke liye silence
lena padta na.
(MORE) 
12.
KARAN (CONT'D) 
Ab bataunga toh theek se hi. Aisa
depressed soul thodi hu me.
DR. ANJALI
Hahaha. Fine. Continue.
KARAN
Tho Ye aryan ko execution of a plan
kabhi bhi nahi jhepa tha. party
chalu wo karne waala tha, aur end
me mujhe aana tha. ye pagal, mujhe
leke jaata hai. udhar koi bhi nahi
hai ha. bas hum dono baithe hain,
and we are waiting for our friends
to arrive.
DR. ANJALI
Great start to a surprise party.
KARAN
Arre phir kya aisa waisa samjho mat
ye party ko.
DR. ANJALI
Was there ever a hint of hate
towards aryan for not doing stuff
properly?
KARAN
Kya? Nahi. Kyu?
DR. ANJALI
I mean, he is basically looking to
be the very reason for stuff going
wrong.
KARAN
Ha but hatred?
DR. ANJALI
Let me rephrase then. Did he make
you feel unimportant? It was your
birthday Karan. Kitna bhi deny
kiya, normal humans feel some need
of being treated nicely on their
birthday.
KARAN
Ha toh itna plan kiya wo kam hai
kya?
13.
DR. ANJALI
Execute achhe se nahi kiya uska
kya?
KARAN
Aryan ko bad light me kyu portray
karna hai?
DR. ANJALI
Mujhe jitni story boli hai, usme se
ye samajh aa raha hai, ki aryan did
not fully commit to making the day
good.
KARAN
Day chalu hua hai? Nahi. Uska haath
sprain ho gaya toh kya kar sakta
tha wo? Ye dusre par blame karke
kya hone waala hai? Look at the
good side. Mere liye itna karna hi
is a big thing.
DR. ANJALI
Ok then when did the nightmares
start?
KARAN
(deep breaths and doesn't
speak) mujhe nahi pata,
but after the party.
DR. ANJALI
panic attacks ?
KARAN
A week after the nightmares.
BEAT.
DR. ANJALI
what did you see in your dreams?
KARAN
Roz aate hain wo.
DR. ANJALI
Koi ek common image hoti hai? Any
person, any memory, any object?
KARAN
Yes.
14.
DR. ANJALI
what is the image?
KARAN
BEAT.
My hands have, blood on them.
DR. ANJALI
What about Aryan? Is he in your
dreams?
KARAN
What? Nahi bilkul nahi.
DR. ANJALI
Okay.
KARAN
Ek baat bolu, Aryan ka kuch problem
kabhi tha nahi. Maybe uski wajah se
events hue, but uski direct koi bhi
galti nahi hai.
DR. ANJALI
It is your story. You do know
better. You know what, lets
continue. Lets hear the whole
thing. Waise bhi u seem to be
excited to tell it.
KARAN
Because hai wo interesting.
DR. ANJALI
Yes please go ahead.
KARAN
Kya bolra tha? Bhul gaya. Pch.
DR. ANJALI
You reached the house with Aryan.
KARAN
Haa. Toh maine kaha-
7.EXT. PARTY HOUSE. 5:40                                   7
Both of them staring towards the building.
KARAN
Tune bola tha bungalow wagera rent
kiya hai.
15.
ARYAN
Ha arre kaisa hai, me galat bola.
Ye building ka top floor aur
terrace rent kiya hai.
KARAN
Tu kabhi full information nahi dega
na?
ARYAN
Arre theek hai na ab, ho gaya na,
aa gaye na, chal na ab andar. Bro
ka birthday hai, zara khush dikh!
KARAN
Ha ha chal. Gawthi jaise baat mat
kar.
2E.INT. PSY ROOM. DAY                                    2E
KARAN
Ab problem ye tha, ki usne bulaya
sabko tha after 7, lekin hum udhar
aa gaye the at 5:40 ya 5:45, taaki
wo jaake starting ka sab arrange
kar sake. But ab iska haath sprain
ka sab hua, uski wajah se meri
surprise birthday party ka sab
arrangement me hi karte baitha tha.
Dr. Does not speak, just smiles.
KARAN
Ya then humara ek pura awkward
ghanta khatam hota hai, and jaise
hi, and i mean JAISE HI! Andhera
hota hai, usi moment pe, aise
instantaneously sabke sab aa jaate
hain.
8.I/E. PARTY HOUSE ENTRY (PARTY HOUSE). 7:10              8
We see 3 boys, WREHAN SINGHANIA, AKASH GOYAL, VEDANT MEHRA,
all aged 18, richly dressed, or seeming to be richly dressed
checking their hairstyles and faces. They all have no facial
hair.
AKASH
Kya bro me achha dikhra kya?
VEDANT
In general puchhra ki abhi ka?
16.
AKASH
Seedha seedha jawaab de na, kyu
insult karna hai?
VEDANT
Insult kaha bhai, mazak kar raha
hu. Mast dikhra tu. Ekdum Wrehan ke
level ka.
WREHAN
Ha ha bas ab. Tera wo sarcastic
tone samajhta hai mujhe.
VEDANT
Kya ab. Me kuch achha bola toh bhi
aisa hi way me lete tum log.
WREHAN
Gifts laae ho na sab?
VEDANT
Ha.
AKASH
Ha laya hu.
WREHAN
Chalo phir.
(claps hands)
They turn towards the door, and start walking towards the
flat. They ring the bell, and Aryan opens the door.
9.INT. HALL (ALL PARTS). NIGHT.                            9
WREHAN
Arre hi hi! Aur? Birthday boy kidar
hai?
ARYAN

We see Karan emerge, and we follow all of them walking
towards Karan.
WREHAN/ARYAN/VEDANT
HAPPY BIRTHDAY KARAN/BRO/ETC.
WREHAN
Arre tujhe pata hai hum sabne,
specially ye aryan ne mast surprise
party plan ki thi, par ye bhai tho
management me expert hi hai na.
(MORE) 
17.
WREHAN (CONT'D) 
(forced and kinda real laughter)
KARAN
Arre chalta hai usme kuch nahi.
Itna socha wahi bahut hai mere
liye.
AKASH
Hmmmm... abhi bahut humble banra
hai, andar se usko bhi pata hai.
KARAN
Kya pata hai?
AKASH
Kuch nahi bhai mazak karra tha.
(to Aryan)
Kya haath tod diya tu.
ARYAN
Kyu re? Ye dekhke Shanaya ka trauma
yaad aara kya?
AKASH
Saale-usko kyu beech me -
VEDANT
Usko chhod re tu. (to aryan) Tu
mereko pehle ek baat bata, party ka
kya scene hai?
(hand gestures signalling
cigarettes)
ARYAN
Usko sab nahi bataya hai me. Utna
thoda surprise rehne de.
VEDANT
Oh okay okay.
Here Vedant's and Akash's voices fade and we continue with
Aryan and Wrehan towards Mallory. She has entered the party
right now.
AKASH
Hello hello hello! Bahut time pe aa
gaye ho.
18.
MALLORY
Oh come on. I know tu bhi abhi hi
aaya hai.
AKASH
But tumse toh pehle hi aa gaya hu
na.
MALLORY
toh kya award chahiye kya koi ab
tujhe?
AKASH
Arre award jaane de. Tu gift kya
laayi hai?
MALLORY
Oh i have got karan a really really
sweet gift.
AKASH

MALLORY
Ahmmm... ya
AKASH
Very innovative. Chal price bhi
guess karta... 200 ka khareeda hai
na?
MALLORY
Ha sabko chilla chilla ke batade
ab. Kyu tang kar raha hai mujhe
yaar!
WREHAN
Arre bas na akash ab. Kyu use
takleef dera?
MALLORY
Ha na. See Wrehan kitna achha hai.
Always nice to everyone.
AKASH
Even i am nice to everyone, just
not to you.
MALLORY
Ha theek hai chal nikal. Ab offend
ho jaaungi me samjha na?
Wrehan seems eager to ask Mallory something. He tries to end
the conversation here.
19.
WREHAN
Use jaane de na Mallory. Tu aa
idhar aa.
Akash is left behind.
MALLORY
Kaise dost hain yaar tere.
WREHAN
Mazak kar raha tha wo. Don't listen
to him. Tu mujhe bata...
MALLORY
Ya ya ya ya, i know what u wanna
ask.
WREHAN
What?
MALLORY
Aa rahi hai wo. Uski mom ka call aa
gaya tha isliye she didnt come in
with me.
WREHAN
(blushes but not in a
cringe way) cool.
MALLORY
Awww how cutely blushing you are!
WREHAN
Kuch bhi.
MALLORY
(excited and looking
towards the door)
There she is.
We follow mallory towards the door, while we watch her open
it and reveal someone standing there.
At this very moment, The beautiful ALICIA (17) enters. A
girl that anyone would be fond of, at first site and after
getting to know her. She makes Wrehan go internally crazy.
We enter the house with her and Mallory, and we reach near
Wrehan.
She enters,and we see how beautiful she is.
WREHAN
Hi.
20.
Alicia nods in greeting, but straight away passes Wrehan
towards Karan to wish him.
ALICIA
Happy birthday Karan!
KARAN
Thank you sooo much! Mujhe ye
vishwaas hi nahi ho raha ki tum sab
mere liye itna aa gaye.
ALICIA
Oh come on itna humble banne ki
zarurat nahi hai. Plus ye aur achha
hota tha if Aryan hadn't given up
the plan.
ARYAN
Arre bas na ab. Ho gaya na, aa gaye
na, kar diya na wish, abhi bhi itna
kyu bolte rehna hai ha?
KARAN
Yes yes exactly. Ab koi bhi Aryan
ko kuch bhi nahi bolega. Clear?
Here Wrehan enters the discussion from behind.
WREHAN
Kisko kya nahi bolna hai?
KARAN
Kuch nahi aise hi time pass.
Karan and Aryan leave because someone calls them. A small
pause. No one talks. Then Wrehan turns towards Alicia.
WREHAN
Hi.
ALICIA
Hey.
WREHAN
(after a small pause) is
that Versace?
ALICIA
Nice guess! But no yaar wo tho itna
mehnga aata hai na, don't ask.
21.
WREHAN
Well you have all the money in this
world. Why do you care about the
cost?
ALICIA
Kuch bhi ha. I am not ameer or
anything.
WREHAN
You dress good tho. That you have
to accept.
Alicia chuckles, but now enters Mallory to try and be in the
conversation.
MALLORY
Kya baatein ho rahi hain ha? Zara
hume bhi toh batao.
ALICIA
Kuch nahi. Bas ye pata chala, ki
Wrehan here has a good sense of
smell.
MALLORY
Achha?! Aisa kyu?
ALICIA
He guessed my perfume brand isliye.
MALLORY
Achha? Wah yaar... chal ab mujhe
bata, maine konsa lagaya hai?
Mallory swings her hand towards Wrehan for him to smell, but
she does it a bit too fast, hitting Wrehan on the nose.
WREHAN
(in pain) AAH! Mallory
what the hell man!
MALLORY
Itna bhi ganda smell nahi hoga
yaar.
WREHAN
(in anger) Smell?! tu
literally mujhe mu par
maari abhi!
Alicia exits.

22.
MALLORY
Oh god! Wrehan tu theek hai? Wrehan
I'm so so so sorry yaar! Mujhe
maarna nahi tha.
WREHAN
(still in pain) ha ha
pata hai. its fine.
MALLORY
Nahi tu chal mere saath. I'll get
you ice.
WREHAN
Rehne de na. You have already done
enough.
Wrehan says that and walks away. Mallory is left behind
here.
HOLD on Mallory. The one shot ends.
10.INT. HALL. NIGHT.                                      10
(faded indistinct voices
from all of the people
in the party.)
The hall is full of these 8 people, with everyone
indistinctively conversing among each other. (Vedant, Akash
Aryan together, Alicia and Mallory together, with Wrehan
glancing at Alicia.) Karan gets up to go somewhere.
11.INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT                                    11
We get close to Karan talking, and then him turning back to
get some pepsi. Suddenly, he sees Niharika Malhotra(18), a
dark eyed and weirdly dressed friend of his, standing  there
in the kitchen, in a corner. She is playing with the kitchen
knife, and has a pomegranate in her other hand.
He suddenly notices her and is startled to death.
KARAN
OH MY GOD! Tu kab aayi?!
NIHARIKA
7:30
(saade saath)
23.
KARAN
(awkward and confused)
Toh bahar kyu nahi aayi?!
She starts coming out of the corner towards KARAN.
NIHARIKA
Tujhe pata hai na ki logo ko dekhke
mujhe unki death ke baare me sab
pata chal jaata hai?
KARAN
Ha ha ha... very funny.
NIHARIKA
(does not move even one
inch, not body nor face)
KARAN
Tu mazak karri. Right?
NIHARIKA
Anyways, Birthday.
KARAN
Ya. Thanks for coming ha.
NIHARIKA
Waise mujhe birthdays ya wedding
ceremonies pasand nahi hain. Agar
kisi ka divorce, ya death, ya
funeral ho, me pahuch jaati hu. So
for me this... is a nightmare.
KARAN
Ahmmm, why do you talk like this?
NIHARIKA
Like how?
KARAN
Like this.
NIHARIKA
You want to say creepy or
depressing?
KARAN
Both man. Both.
NIHARIKA
(chuckles)
Kaisa funny hai. Tum sab jo karte
ho wo mujhe creepy lagta hai.
(MORE) 
24.
NIHARIKA (CONT'D) 
(laughs very loudly and
stops suddenly)
KARAN
Calm the hell down woman!
NIHARIKA
Anyways, ye le. gift.
She hands him a beeping device. It is beeping and lighting
up at the same time.
KARAN
(forcefully)
Awww...
NIHARIKA
You literally have no idea what
that is. Right?
KARAN
Nope no idea.
NIHARIKA
Achha hai. Because nobody in this
world knows about what that is.
KARAN
Kya hai ye?
NIHARIKA
Tujhe pata hai na ki in saare
subhumans me, bas tu hi ek mujhe
normal lagta hai?
KARAN
I do not take that as a compliment.
NIHARIKA
It is a fact not a compliment.
KARAN
Ya okay but uska kya?
NIHARIKA
So, this, is a machine.
KARAN
Ha utna samajh me aa raha hai.
25.
NIHARIKA
Wo jo machine tune apne haath me
pakdi hai, wo meri heartbeat hai.
KARAN
(looks at her in
confusion.)
NIHARIKA
(con't)
Jis moment pe, and i mean jis
moment pe, ye machine beep karna
band karegi na, tu samajh lena, ki
me mar gayi.
KARAN
(laughs)
Matlab kuch bhi. Kya yaar itna kon
melodramatic hota ha-
Niharika slaps him very hard before he can complete the
sentence, bangs him on the fridge and then pulls him close
by holding his shirt.
NIHARIKA
Me is duniya me wo har cheez se
khush hoti hu jisse baaki logo ke
mu pe dukh aa jaae. I do not lie to
anyone like you people do, bas iss
liye taaki saamne waala tumhari
kadar kar sake ya tumhari ek image
bana le. Me jo sach hai, wahi bolti
aa rahi hu, aur wahi bolte aaungi.
Toh agar tujhe lag raha hai ki me
timepass me tujhe meri sabse
important cheez de rahi hu, wo bhi
tujhpe trust karke, toh you don't
know me.
BEAT.
KARAN
(shocked)
Nahi nahi me aisa nahi bolna chahta
tha. I meant, it is beautiful. I
actually do like it.
Niharika leaves him.
NIHARIKA
Me creepy nahi, enlightened hu.
KARAN
I know.
26.
NIHARIKA
Rakh wo pocket me hi rakh. And jab
band ho jaaega na, me mari hui
milungi tujhe kahi toh.
KARAN
Bas re kitna marne ka baat karri?
Birthday hai na. Enjoy kar.
AKASH GOYAL enters the frame, and sees NIHARIKA. He checks
her out from bottom to top and then smiles at her. Niharika
looks at him, gives a disgusting and a creepy look, and
walks away. The moment she turns her back, Akash checks her
out, and gets all awestruck and excited.
AKASH
(Flirtatious)
Oh bhai sahab. Kya re ye bandi kon
hai ha?
KARAN
Akash. Shanaya ka flashback
chahiye?
AKASH
Yaar usko kyu beech me- bro i am a
changed man.
Karan just looks at Akash with disbelief and sarcastic
agreement.
AKASH
Pch chal re chal bas.
Akash moves out of the kitchen to the main area, and Karan
moves just a bit out of the kitchen.
10A.INT. HALL. NIGHT.                                    10A
We cut directly to the hall, where everyone is sitting.
KARAN
Aryan idhar aa ek second.
ARYAN
Kya hua?
KARAN
Pepsi ka problem hai shaayad, ye
dekh na.
Aryan gets up and moves towards Karan.
27.
12.INT. HALL OR KITCHEN. NIGHT.                           12
KARAN
Tu niharika ko kyu bulaya be?
ARYAN
Wo aa gayi? Good good.
KARAN
Good kya hai usme bhai? Tereko pata
hai na kitni weird hai wo?
ARYAN
Arre sabko pata hai wo aisa masti
ke liye karti hai wo sab. Utna kyu
seriously leta hai usko?
KARAN
Mereko na uska wo time pass bhi
nahi jamta theek hai.
ARYAN
Tereko paisa thodi bharna hai uska.
Hum sab apna contri karke dere
hain. Tu mat tension le.
KARAN
Tu pagal hai kya re? Paise ka baat
nahi hai ye. Overall mahaaul kharab
karti hai wo.
ARYAN
Nahi karegi, me guarantee dera.
Bas?
KARAN
(thinks)
Ha theek hai.
ARYAN
Chal ab bahar chal.
 KARAN
Tu jaa me aata hu.
Aryan leaves. Karan removes the beeping device from his
pocket and then takes a close look at it
POV: Karan looking at the Device.
CU. Karan stares and stares at it, but then zones out. He
keeps it back in his pocket and forgets about it.
28.
13.INT. HALL. NIGHT                                       13
Karan moves towards the hall, where he sees Aryan and
Mallory arguing about something.
 Here the shot shows everyone in the frame. Wrehan, Alicia
and Vedant are sitting, and dont really give a shit about
the arguement. All 3 of them are looking into one single
phone.
Niharika is on the left hand corner of the frame, standing
doing nothing.
 Akash is on the right hand corner, with a glass with
something in it. He is taking slow sips out of it. Aryan and
Mallory are sitting in the center, with Karan still a bit
off from the centre.
ARYAN
mera sambandh hai ki nahi uska alag
topic ho jaaega phir.
MALLORY
Nahi.
AKASH
Ek second ek second. Karan ko
puchho na. Kya pata end me uska
kuch alag hi rahega.
KARAN
Heh?
MALLORY
dekh. Aryan is saying ki agar hum
log gossip kar rahe honge, toh hume
right to information ya something
hona hi chahiye.
ARYAN
right to information wagera bada
bada shabt mat bol. Me bas bola ki
agar mere baare me kuch fail raha
hai, toh i have the right to know
ki kon faila raha hai.
MALLORY
But tujhe agar pata hi hai, ki wo
cheez jhoot hai, toh kyu sochna hai
itna? Like leave it na.

29.
ARYAN
Aisa nahi hota hai re. Abhi soch
agar tere baare me kuch bola rehta,
toh tujhe lagta nahi kya ki lets
know who is talking shit about me?
Niharika exits the room towards the kitchen.
MALLORY
Lagta toh tha par then i can't do
anything about it can I?
ARYAN
Wahi toh bola na me. You can do
something, tu direct puchh sakti
hai ki kaha se faila hai ye, aur
kisne failaya.
MALLORY
Par me puchhi toh bhi wo saamne
waala nahi bataega.
ARYAN
Kyu nahi bataega?
MALLORY
CU. Arre because wo snitching ho
jaaega na!
ARYAN
CU. Snitch tab hi hota hai na jab
tu kisi ki tho side li hai. Yaha
side aata hi nahi hai.
MALLORY
Kaise nahi aati?
ARYAN
Idhar toh right or wrong ka baat
chalra hai.
 Akash leaves the hall.
MALLORY
Nahi.
ARYAN
Abhi tu aisa bolri just because
tereko tera point prove karna hai.
30.
MALLORY
Point toh prove ho gaya hai mera.
Me kisi ko trust karke kuch bolu
aur wo jaake mera naam batade, ye
achhi baat thodi hai.
ARYAN
Me thodi bolra ki saamne se aisa
sab kuch bol hi daalo. Me bas bolra
ki agar wo aadmi puchha, aisa full
concern ke saath, toh batane me
kuch wrong nahi hai.
Suhani Singh, a wrongly dressed girl enters the party.
KARAN
Suhani hii!
SUHANI
Happy birthday bhai. Sorry ha late
ho gayi. Wo aisa traffic bahut tha.
Upar se ghar se hi late nikli na
toh wo sab gadbad ho gayi.
KARAN
Arre koi problem nahi. Tu aa gayi
na, bas hai utna hi.
MALLORY
Gossip ka koi concern nahi hota ha.
ARYAN
Ha theek hai phir tere baare me sab
faila dete hum, phir tu dekhte reh.
SUHANI
Inka kya chal raha hai?
KARAN
Puchh mat.
MALLORY
See now i know tu hi kiya rahega
agar kuch hua toh. Tu saamne se hi
bola.
ARYAN
Aae arre tu kya yedi hai kya? Kya
matlab? argument ka basis tho bana
pehle!
MALLORY
See who's talking.
31.
Wrehan interrupts in haste.
WREHAN
ARRE BAS AB. You both proved your
points theek hai? This is
opinionated. Aisa ye sahi hai, ye
galat hai, aisa kuch nahi hai ye
argument me. Bina kaam ke ladho mat
tum dono.
ALICIA
Ya Man... just calm down, both of
you.
ARYAN
(jokingly)
Arre ladh nahi rahe the bro...
healthy debate bolte na wo tha ye.
For some weird reason, Vedant loses his temper.
VEDANT
HA NA! ARYAN CHUP NA!
ARYAN
Arre?
VEDANT
KABSE PUCHHRA PARTY KAB CHALU
KAREGA, BATA HI NAHI RAHA! KYA AISE
HI AAYA HAI KYA ME?
KARAN
Kya party bhai? Isme khush nahi
hai?
ARYAN
Arre nahi bhai uska ek alag plan
tha.
KARAN
Finally something that I don't know
about. Achha hai na surprise?
ARYAN
Apne bhai ko kya aisa waisa
samajhta hai kya?
VEDANT
Arre terrace ka kya plan hai?!
KARAN
Kya terrace ka plan?!
32.
Everybody look at vedant. Vedant and Aryan both smirk.
HOLD on Vedant and Aryan.
CUT TO:
14.EXT. TOP TERRACE. NIGHT                                14
 ( To be shot in 50 (highest) frames per second. scene
accompanied by tune like devil in a new dress.)
The scene changes directly to everybody sitting in one line,
drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and vedant snorting
coke. They are of course having the time of their life.
Alicia seems to be in control and mallory tries to remain
really dry, but can't.
 This continues for a while. Wrehan and Alicia are together
the whole time, but then Mallory is always intervening. All
are high.
Aryan and Vedant keep snorting lines, and Vedant kinda does
a lot of lines in a minute. After seeing what everyone is
doing to get high, we get back to Aryan.
ARYAN
(to vedant)
Bhai?
Vedant does not respond.
ARYAN
Bhai?
(slapping his face)
Seeing Vedant not move, Aryan panics, and starts shouting.
ARYAN
(to all)
Ye hil nahi raha!
AKASH
Kya?
ARYAN
Vedant hil nahi raha yaar!
(starts tearing up.)
WREHAN
Utha usko wo side se utha.
They pick vedant up, and keep him on the floor.
33.
POV: Everybody stares at vedant lying down. They don't
really know what to do, and how to react.
ARYAN
Bro ab kya karenge?
MALLORY
Doctor ko call karo na koi toh!
WREHAN
Ye glucon-D soonghke nahi behosh
hua hai madam.
AKASH
Uski mummy ko call karo na.
ARYAN
(in frustration)
Isko kon bulaya hai re?
WREHAN
Tu.
We hear Karan come from behind, and pour a glass of water on
Vedant. Vedant gets up with a jerk, but doesn't speak.
Everyone looks at Karan with awe for thinking about
splashing water.
KARAN
Theek hai?
VEDANT
Bhai mere sapne me jatayu aaya,
mereko ek plate pe bhendi ki sabzi
aur 2 roti deke chala gaya.
WREHAN
Yup. This is an indication to stop.
MALLORY
Ya better we stop. Zyaada kiya toh
problem ho sakta.
ARYAN
Suno re pehle. Ek kaam karte.
Neeche jaate, mast naachte. Aisa
baaki sab normal normal peete, aur
phir ye sab utar jaaega, ghar pe
pata hi nahi chalega.

34.
WREHAN
Point tho correct hai.
VEDANT
Abbe nahi yaar abhi toh chalu kiya
tha. Itna jaldi band nahi karneka
hai yaaaar.
ARYAN
saale tere jatayu ke time pe mereko
laga tereko yamraj leke gaya. Chup
chaap neeche chal.
No one says anything, and then again Aryan speaks.
ARYAN
Nice.
CUT TO:
15.INT. HALL. NIGHT                                      15
The DJ is on full volume, with english songs soaring through
the roof. These people are enjoying the shit out of
themselves. The dance moves are at their pinnacle.
Wrehan and alicia definitely have a connection. Wrehan is
moving towards Alicia again, and she is liking that. This
chemistry is lovely for sure.
Here Akash sees Suhani for the first time, and so does
Suhani. Suhani is dancing very very weirdly, and for some
reason, Akash is madly attracted to that. He slowly moves
towards her.
Even though the music is at its peak, there is a loud voice
that everyone hears. Vedant stops the music at once.
everyone looks at the door to see who has entered.
 It is Shubham Patil (18), a big personality, Alicia's
boyfriend from the past 4 years, and of course, not a keen
friend of Wrehan.
SHUBHAM
(JOYFULLY)
Namaskar Mandali!
Aryan happily moves towards him, but we see Wrehan and
Vedant not that happy. Alicia seems to have lost all
interest in the party because the last thing she wanted
there was her boyfriend.

35.
Shubham moves inside, with Rupak Phule (17) and Vasu Jagtap
(17).
SHUBHAM
Vadhdivsachya tumhala hardik
shubhhechha!
KARAN
Thank you bhai thank you!
SHUBHAM
Arre wo kidar hai? Tera item?
ARYAN
Idhar idhar.
SHUBHAM
Arre tu kidar location dhoonda hai

house hi le leta mera.
(laughs very
artificially)
ARYAN
Arre chhod ab. Ye sab planning
waisa bhi hag hi diya hai, toh ab

RUPAK
Haaaapy barthde bhau.
VASU
Ha re happy birthday.
KARAN
Thank you thank you.
VASU

(hands him the cake)
SHUBHAM
Ye saala aadha party kar liye ho

ARYAN
Arre nahi re abhi hi chalu kiya. Tu
tension mat le re.
SHUBHAM
Chalu kiya rehta na tho idhar hi
kaatke fek deta tereko.
There is an awkward silence.
36.
SHUBHAM
Arre mazak karra hu bhai.
(laughs awkwardly again)
Wrehan calls karan from behind.
15A.INT. HALL OTHER PART. NIGHT                          15A
WREHAN
Bro. Ek second.
KARAN
Ha.
WREHAN
Aryan sachme dimaag pe gira hai
kya?
KARAN
(a bit concious and
scared)
Bhai tumhara abhi bhi raada hai
kya?
WREHAN
Why are you asking the obvious
things man? Of course hai!
KARAN
Mujhe ye kon aara kuch pata nahi
hai. Mujhe tho niharika ka bhi pata
nahi tha. Tereko koi apni heartbeat
diya hai?
WREHAN
Kya?
KARAN
Lucky hai tu.
WREHAN
Tu topic mat change kar.
KARAN
Arre par ab me kya usko jaane bolu
kya? Wo hi toh cake laaya hai!
WREHAN
First of all tu itne gawthi bachho
se kyu baat karta hai pata nahi.
KARAN
Kuch gawthi nahi hai wo.
37.
WREHAN
Ya look at that dressing sense man.
Just kya bolra ye sochke toh bol.
Gawthi nahi hai bolra.
KARAN
Meri jamti hai unke saath, unhone
mujhe toh kabhi kuch nahi kiya.
WREHAN
Dekh i dont know anything about
that. Agar wo idhar hai toh me nahi
rahunga.
KARAN
Tu uska gussa merepe kyu nikal raha
hai bhai? Chill na.
WREHAN
Dekh chill wagera kuch nahi hota
hai. I dont want him here.
KARAN
Achha theek hai ruk. Me baat karta
Aryan se.
WREHAN
Please.
Karan moves towards Shubham.
15B.INT. HALL. NIGHT.                                    15B
SHUBHAM
Bhai ye kaise kaise logo ko bulaya
hai ha? Chhi!
KARAN
Dekh teri item bhi hai. Aisa mat
bol kaise kaise log.
SHUBHAM
Tereko pata hai me kiski baat karra
hu.
KARAN
Ha pata hai. But ab tum dono ka
apna mamla hai na, meri party hai
toh aisa neutral ho gaya na?

38.
SHUBHAM
Kya badbadra tu? Mereko pata rehta
na ye chikni chhipkali idhar areli,
me toh aata hi nahi idhar.
KARAN
Achha matlab mera birthday ka
importance hi nahi.
SHUBHAM
Kuch bhi kya. Bhai ka badday hai.
Aise kaise?
Shubham sees alicia there.
POV of Subham: Alicia chuckling and laughing. She is far
from him. She is running her hands through her hair. She is
happy.
SHUBHAM
Tu cake ka dekh, me baaki log se
mil lu zara.
(smiles)
KARAN
Hmmmmmm... achha hai achha hai
SHUBHAM
(blushes)
Chal re. Bas ab.
Shubham exits.
HOLD on Karan. He is furious.
16.INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT                                   16
KARAN
Ayy Aryan idhar aa ye cake ka dekh

ARYAN
Ha idhar rakh de wo, ruk knife
kida-
KARAN
Tu kya lafda kiya hai ha?
ARYAN
Kya?
KARAN
Tereko pata hai.
39.
ARYAN
Kya?
KARAN
Innocent mat ban ab.
ARYAN
Abbe girlfriend nahi hai tu meri!
Kya bolra theek se bol.
KARAN
Tu Wrehan aur Shubham dono ko kyu
bulaya?
ARYAN
Abbe wo dono tere dost hai na?
KARAN
Ha par unka aapas me nahi jamta, ye
pure duniya ko pata hai.
ARYAN
Par birthday tera hai.
KARAN
Aryan tera system kuch alag hai
kya?
ARYAN
Arre kya aisa ijjat nikalta hai.
Itna kya hua?
KARAN
Tu itna nahi samajh paara kya ki
agar do logo ka aapas me nahi
jamta, toh unko ek saath nahi
bulana chahiye?
ARYAN
Par party toh tera hai.
KARAN
Arre gawthi aadmi! Tu literally
pura birthday ka wat lagara idhar!
Pehle toh mera surprise party
mereko hi start karna pada. Ek
ghanta apne hi party ka sab
arrangement kiya, phir ye Niharika
ko bulaya, theek hai chal galti
hoti hai. Par ye aisa in dono ko
bulana accident nahi hai. Ye bas
dimaag kam hai.

40.
ARYAN
(pause)
Bhai tu chidh gaya kya?
KARAN
Arre yaar ajeeb log hain re ye.
Apan jaise nahi hain. Wo dimaag me
leke plan karta tha na yaar.
ARYAN
Bhai sorry. Tu bas ab half hone ke
baad dukhi mat ho.
KARAN
Dukhi nahi hu bas... frustrate ho
gaya.
ARYAN
Achha chal unko aane hi nahi dete
aamne saamne.
CUT TO:
17.INT. HALL. NIGHT                                       17
Alicia is walking towards the cake cutting area, and Vasu
stops in front of her. She changes directions, and then is
blocked by Rupak. With only one exit left, she is faced to
Shubham.
SHUBHAM
(happily)
Hii.
ALICIA
(not that keen)
Hey.
SHUBHAM
Tum sab kabse aae ho idhar?
ALICIA
About an hour... i dont know.
SHUBHAM
Baapre. Matlab hum hi late ho gaye.
ALICIA
Yeah.
41.
Alicia is about to leave but Shubham makes her wait.
SHUBHAM
Arre kidar jaari?
ALICIA
baat ho gayi na?
SHUBHAM
Alicia tu abhi bhi satki hai mere
pe?
ALICIA
Shubham this is not a good time.
SHUBHAM
Arre but me tereko pehle hi bola na
sorry itne baar. Phirse bolu kya?
ALICIA
You seriously think that is going
to convince me?
SHUBHAM
Please na. Hota rehta hai ye sab,
tu kya kabhi baat hi nahi karegi
kya ab?
ALICIA
Not a bad idea.
SHUBHAM
(bit angry)
Toh kya karna hai ab ha? Aise baat
nahi karke kuch thodi sort hone
waala ha?
ALICIA
Tere bolne se me nahi maanne waali.
I'll talk to you when I feel like
talking to you.
SHUBHAM
tu ek baar  -
He is cut in the middle of his sentence by a loud thud. It
is Mallory who has shouted. Alicia takes this oppurtunity
and leaves at that very instance.
18.INT. TERRACE. NIGHT                                    18
Alicia reaches there, and sees mallory crying.
42.
ALICIA
Oh shit!
Mallory is lying down because of how high she is. She is
wasted.
MALLORY
(slurred voice)
Alicia?
ALICIA
Are you okay??
MALLORY
Amitabh Bachhan mast polio drop
deta hai yaaaaar.
Aryan and Karan reach there.
ARYAN
Ye kya hai?
KARAN
Lady Vedant.
Karan starts adjusting her so that she is comfortable.
KARAN
Tu paani leke aa zara. Kanda bhi
leke aa.
ARYAN
Bro.
KARAN
Kya?
ARYAN
Wo jain hai.
KARAN
Kha nahi rahi hai bas sunghana hai.
Come on.
ARYAN
Apne pe naam nahi daalne mangti ki
uska dharam bhrasht karre apan.
KARAN
Tu tera mu band rakh zara, aur
kanda la chup chaap.

43.
Niharika is seeing all this happen. She is standing there
without doing anything. Seconds later, she starts crying.
KARAN
Niharika? Kya hua?
NIHARIKA
Me khush hu Karan. Ye dekhke, ki tu
logo ki kitni help karta hai. Ye
khushi ke aansu hai.
Karan finds this very weird. He gets up, goes towards her.
She stares at him for a while with her eyes constantly
tearing up. She holds his face, smiles, and leaves.
Karan does not know how to respond to this. He is just then
approached by Rupak.
RUPAK
Cake laga diya hai me.
CUT TO:
19.INT. HALL. NIGHT                                      19
Everybody but Niharika have gathered around to sing happy
birthday. Karan cuts the cake. Wrehan takes some cake and
gives it to Alicia. Shubham sees this but does nothing.
Suddenly Shubham shouts.
SHUBHAM
Music laga re!
VASU
(to vedant)
Hat na re jellyfish.
Vasu starts playing a marathi DJ song, and everyone starts
vibing to it, except Wrehan and Alicia. Shubham takes all
the chances he has to get near Alicia, and insult Wrehan.
there is not a word spoken, but we know Wrehan has been
intimidated.
20.INT. ROOM 1. NIGHT                                    20
Akash and Suhani are sitting there, in the cringiest way
possible, just staring at each other. They blush, then look
away. Suhani makes weird sounds and Akash of course, likes
that.

44.
at one point Akash holds Suhani's hand and starts moving
inside the room towards the bed. just as he reaches the bed,
Suhani becomes a bit scared of taking things ahead.
SUHANI
Akash you sure?
AKASH
Trust me Suhani. Its gonna be fun.
She still a bit hesitant, climbs into the bed, and Akash
again starts looking at her in that cringe and weird way.
She reciprocates.
At this moment Akash goes in on suhani but her reflexes make
her move away from him. He sees this, and stops a bit.
Thinking of upsetting Akash, Suhani now gets confident and
lays down on the bed, with Akash following the same. He
blushes in a bad way.
Vasu now wanting to go to the toilet, accidentally opens the
door where these two are, and sees these two lying in the
bed. They both get really conscious and get up quickly.
Vasu smiles, in a bad way, teases him, and leaves.
As he leaves, these two start blushing again.
19A.INT. HALL. NIGHT                                     19A
Shubham dances and gets very close to Alicia. Alicia becomes
uncomfortable, and Wrehan steps in.
Alicia goes away somewhere.
WREHAN
(to Shubham)
Distance.
SHUBHAM
Aae aukaat dekhke baat kar mere se.
WREHAN
Arre ja re chal nikal.
RUPAK
Bhai jaando kiske mu lagrele.
Chhodo na.
WREHAN
Wahi. Go talk someone of your
standards.
45.
SHUBHAM
Standard wagera mat nikaal samjha
na? Meri bandi hai wo.
WREHAN
Nikalunga standard. Kya karega tu?
Shubham starts laughing at his threat.
WREHAN
Kya?
SHUBHAM
Tu wajan dekh apna. Kisse panga
lera kuch idea rakh, aukaat me reh,
aur nikal.
RUPAK
Arre bhau chhod na usko tu. Karan
ke party me apna raada kayko
chahiye?
WREHAN
Tere chamche ko tere se zyaada
akkal hai.
RUPAK
Ye chamcha tere andar kaata fork
ghusane se pehle idhar se nikal.
This whole argument is seen by Karan, who approaches them.
KARAN
(dancing)
Kya hua?
SHUBHAM
(starting to dance)
Maja aara na?!
RUPAK
(dancing)
Full electric maja.
Rupak takes Shubham and Karan to the center of the hall and
makes them start dancing. Wrehan being felt alone because
Alicia has gone somewhere, starts searching for her.
He is walking and opening every door in his way. He walks
past a passage, but forgets to check a door there. Alicia
opens that door, whispers his name, and calls him inside.
They go inside the room, and Alicia closes the door.

46.
19B.INT. HALL. NIGHT                                     19B
Karan and Shubham are dancing but it seems like Shubham has
lost interest.
KARAN
Kuch hua hai kya bhai?
SHUBHAM
Sab takatak hai re, tu naach na.
KARAN
Me naachra hai, tu hi aisa dukhi ho
gaya hai achanak.
Shubham doesnt reply.
KARAN
Alicia kidar hai?
SHUBHAM
...
KARAN
Bhai?
SHUBHAM
Ha bol.
KARAN
Alicia kuthe?
SHUBHAM
Pata nahi.
KARAN
Aise kya bolra? Pata nahi matlab?
SHUBHAM
Malum nahi re.
KARAN
(after a pause)
Kuch hua hai kya tera aur uska?
Shubham again does not reply, but this time he stops dancing
totally.
HOLD on Shubham.
21.INT. SECRET ROOM. NIGHT.                              21
Alicia has closed the door, and now we see inside the room.
It is a theatre with three recliners, and a huge screen.
47.
There is no one, and no sound of the music playing outside.
Silence it is. Not an awkward silence, but an anxiety
inducing one.
WREHAN
Wow. This house is huge.
ALICIA
Shubham won't find me here, so
thats a plus.
WREHAN
Oh okay, I'll leave you be.
ALICIA
Maine kaha Shubham won't. I dont
mind you being here.
Both stop talking. They want to talk, but have no topic.
Wrehan isnt confident enough to just start talking about her
boyfriend. Alicia makes herself comfortable, and moves to
sit on the sofa. Wrehan moves towards the screen.
WREHAN
This is literally a theatre. In a
house.
ALICIA
Wohi toh!
WREHAN
Aryan ne thaan hi liya tha one of a
kind party organise karni hai.
ALICIA
This room makes me realise ki Aryan
ne itna kharcha kiya hai, ki uska
scheduling bhi agar mess up hua hai
toh bhi he organised it quite well.
WREHAN
And the worst part is usko pata bhi
nahi hoga ki this room exists.
Alicia chuckles. Wrehan sits down near the screen and starts
doing something.
ALICIA
What are you doing?
48.
WREHAN
(still doing something)
Abhi maam aapke facial expressions
se mujhe toh pata chal gaya hai ki
aapko bahar ka music itna achha
laga nahi hai. Toh why not play
music that'll get you in a good
mood?
ALICIA
Well that's a cute thought.
Wrehan finishes arranging. He gets up, and plays the music.
He hits play. A bitsy music starts playing in the
background. He starts moving his body, and tries to lighten
up the mood for Alicia. He dances, and Alicia smiles. She
chuckles.
WREHAN
(laughing)
What?
ALICIA
(laughing)
You cannot dance.
WREHAN
Achha?
Alicia cannot control her laughing. She continues to laugh
at how Wrehan is trying to dance.
WREHAN
Oh come on itna bhi ganda nahi tha
wo.
ALICIA
Ganda? It was the best dance i saw
in my life Wrehan!
Wrehan listening to this, stops the music at once.
ALICIA
ayyy don't stop! i was joking!
WREHAN
Nahi ab tujhe prove karke dikhaunga
ki I am a great dancer.
ALICIA
Oh go ahead.
Wrehan sits down, changes the song to a very romantic
Italian slow song. He suddenly stops the music again.
49.
ALICIA
Kya hua?
Wrehan tries to tangle with the lights inside, and then
turns them blue. The blue being a cold colour, cannot help
to reduce the hotness in the room.
He reaches out his hand to Alicia, and makes her get up and
start dancing with him.
ALICIA
ohhh no no no no I can't dance on
that. Me bahut hasungi.
WREHAN
Kyu? Me itna ganda dikhta hu?
ALICIA
Kuch bhi matlab.
Wrehan and Alicia have an eye contact. They dance for about
10-15 seconds without saying anything. All they do is slowly
move their body to the music. Finally, Alicia breaks the
silence.
ALICIA
You know Wrehan, seeing you this
close has made me realise
something.
WREHAN
(vocalising)
Kya?
ALICIA
(cracking up)
Yahi ki...
 tu ganda dikhta hai.
Alicia loses control and starts laughing. Wrehan to add to
this, starts tickling her.
WREHAN
(laughing)
Achha?
ALICIA
(laughing)
Yes!
They both run around laughing and Wrehan tries to catch
Alicia. She manages to stay away from him for some time but
in the end, Wrehan gets a hold of her just when she sits
down on the sofa.

50.
ALICIA
(panting)
BAS STOP PLEASE!
WREHAN
Oh god i haven't laughed this much
in such a long time.
ALICIA
Wohi!
Wrehan at this moment screams a bit holding his back.
ALICIA
Kya hua??
WREHAN
Kuch nahi kuch nahi.
ALICIA
Arre? Something has happened. kya
hua?
WREHAN
(in pain)
Mere back pe injury hai... wo
football ke waqt hui thi. I need to
keep applying this shit cream.
(removes cream from
pocket)
ALICIA
Baapre.
WREHAN
The worst part is me khud laga bhi
nahi sakta.
Akash ko bula le he'll help me out.
ALICIA
Arre tu bata kidar lagana hai, I'll
do it.
WREHAN
Nahi nahi tu mat kar. Akash kar
dega.
ALICIA
Why because me achhi nahi dikhti.
WREHAN
(laughs)
Hasa mat yaar.
51.
ALICIA
Ha toh de cream.
Wrehan doesn't argue much. He gets up, removes his shirt,
groans a little, and then sits down. Alicia starts applying
the cream.
ALICIA
This good?
WREHAN
uhuh.
WREHAN
(after some seconds)
Ya bas bas thats enough.
ALICIA
You sure na?
WREHAN
Ha.
(leaning back to relax)
Oooh thank you yaar.
ALICIA
See now you owe me.
WREHAN
Yes yes..... I do.
Both smile a bit, and then don't talk. Wrehan looks at
Alicia, but Alicia does not notice. She then looks back,
sees Wrehan looking at her and wanting to ask something.
ALICIA
Kya?
WREHAN
Kuch nahi.
ALICIA
Arre kya hua?
WREHAN
Sachme kuch nahi.
ALICIA
Come on you want to ask
something... ask.
WREHAN
Nahi it's better i don't
52.
ALICIA
Ya ab aisa bolke you made me more
curious. There is no way out now.
WREHAN
Arre jaane de na.
ALICIA
Kitna naatak hai tera... bol jaldi.
WREHAN
Achha fine. But lemme clear ki I
don't mean to cross any line ha...
ALICIA
Yes.
WREHAN
(after a pause)
You are you. Aisa what was so
special in Shubham ki you have been
with him for god knows how many
years?
Alicia looks at him, does not speak for a while. Then she
looks away, takes a deep breath and looks at him again.
HOLD on Alicia.
22.INT. HALL. NIGHT                                       22
Shubham and karan are right there. Karan asks again.
KARAN
Arre bol na.
SHUBHAM
Bhai sab gadbad kar diya hai me.
KARAN
Kya hua?
SHUBHAM
Alicia bahut bhadki hai mere pe.
Aisa kabhi nahi jhagde hum jitna
abhi jhagadre.
KARAN
Tu kya kiya?
SHUBHAM
Arre me sachme kuch nahi kiya.
53.
KARAN
Abhi toh bola gadbad kar diya
SHUBHAM
Ha par jaan boojhke thodi kiya
maine.
KARAN
Kiya kya wo toh bol tu.
SHUBHAM
Wo jo hua wo tu chhod na. But
mereko bas ye samjha hai ki mereko
bahut pasand hai alicia, aur me
usko aisa chhodke nahi jaane de
sakta.
KARAN
Tumhara break up ho sakta?
SHUBHAM
Aisa risk tho hai.
KARAN
Toh tu sorry wagera bola ki nahi
usko?
SHUBHAM
Arre bhajan kiya me sorry ka. Wo
sunti hi nahi hai saala.
KARAN
Sorry aisa feel karke bola ki nahi?
SHUBHAM
Ha re pura pet fugake bola kuch
fayda nahi.
KARAN
Ha matlab theek se nahi bola.
SHUBHAM
Bhai help kar yaar... mereko bahut
pasand hai wo. Me uske liye jo
mangta karega. Aisa kasam lera me.
Karan drinks a pepsi, finishes it, and looks at Shubham.
21A.INT. SECRET ROOM. NIGHT                              21A
We come back to where we left Alicia and Wrehan. She speaks.
ALICIA
He is nice.
54.
WREHAN
(laughs)
Ya okay.
ALICIA
What?
WREHAN
Oh come on tu serious hai? sabko
pata hai ki he landed someone way
out of his league.
ALICIA
Tujhe wo cheeze pata hai na, jo
explain karne ke liye bahut
difficult hoti hain? This is
exactly like that.
WREHAN
I mean I am not asking for an
explanation of something big. Me
bas ye samajh nahi pa raha ki what
do you like in him.
ALICIA
Achha let me ask you one question
then.
WREHAN
Ha puchh.
ALICIA
What's the longest that you have
been in a relationship?
WREHAN
(thinks)
8 months...9 shaayad.
ALICIA
I am with him for 4 years.
WREHAN
Again. why?!
ALICIA
Pehle pehle bahut maza aata tha
uske saath. But then he went into
what we call as bad company. Aisa
nahi hai ki he didn't treat me bad,
uska bas mere liye importance kam
ho gaya, but me wo nahi kar payi
kabhi.
(MORE) 
55.
ALICIA (CONT'D) 
I keep on telling myself ki he is
just distracted, he is just busy.
But no. He just changed his
preferences.
WREHAN
Tu kyu nahi kar payi ye?
ALICIA
When you are with someone who is so
nice to you for 3 or 3.5 years and
then suddenly change, samajh nahi
aata kya karna hai. Its like uski
aadat lag gayi hai mujhe.
Wrehan does not know what to say.
BEAT.
WREHAN
You still feel that way?
HOLD on Alicia.
22A.INT. HALL. NIGHT                                     22A
KARAN
Dekh tu ek kaam kar. Usko dhoondh,
uske paas ja, achhe se baith, uska
haath pakad, aur sorry bol. Pet se
nahi dil se bol.
SHUBHAM
Aur kya warranty hai wo maan
jaaegi?
KARAN
Warranty nahi hota be guarantee
hota hai. Aur wo me nahi dera
tereko.
SHUBHAM
ha saala toh kya fayda?
KARAN
Yede mereko malum hi nahi hai
tumhare beech kya hua hai. Ab jitna
basics malum hai sab bata diya
tereko.
Aryan comes in, and starts pulling Karan to dance.
56.
KARAN
(con't)
 Toh ja, usko dhoondh, aur bol
sorry.
Shubham now is alone there. He contemplates what he has to
say, and then spits on his palms, adjusts his hair using
those hands.
21B.INT. SECRET ROOM. NIGHT.                             21B
Wrehan asks again.
WREHAN
Alicia?
ALICIA
What?
Wrehan gets a bit close to her.
WREHAN
Do you still feel that way about
him?
ALICIA
(exhales)
I don't.
They get closer.
WREHAN
And what do you plan on doing about
it?
Alicia comes very close to him.
ALICIA
I don't really know.
They stare in each other's eyes, not speaking a word. They
are way more close than they should be. Something is about
to happen.
AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OPENS, AND SHUBHAM ENTERS. He sees
them in that position, with Wrehan without a shirt on. This
of course, amplifies his anger EXPONENTIALLY.
HE SPRINTS TOWARDS THEM. Alicia and Wrehan get up at once
but it is too late to do anything. SHUBHAM GRABS WREHAN BY
HIS NECK AND SMASHES HIS HEAD ON HIS KNEE.

57.
SHUBHAM
TERI MAA KA-
ALICIA
(screaming)
SHUBHAM STOP!
Shubham picks wrehan up by his hair again, and punches him
on his chest and then on his back. Wrehan cries in that
pain.
23.INT. HALL. NIGHT.                                     23
Everyone hear that scream of Wrehan even through the music.
They rush towards the sound at once.
24.INT. ROOM 1. NIGHT.                                   24
Akash and Suhani hear the sound too and start moving towards
the room too.
25.INT. SECRET ROOM. NIGHT.                              25
Everybody reach the room to see Shubham beat the shit out of
Wrehan, and see Wrehan cry in help.
At seeing Wrehan get beat up, Akash and Vedant run to beat
up Shubham, but they are literally of no use. Karan and
Aryan try to remove Shubham from the fight and are
successful. They are joined by Rupak and Vasu, and now it is
a 3 on 3, with Karan and Aryan holding them back.
ALICIA
SHUBHAM BAS KAR!
SHUBHAM
AAE HAGRI TU TOH CHUP HI REH SAMJHI
NA?! Tereko toh zyaada thokna
chahiye!
MALLORY
Language dekhke baad kar.

KARAN

SHUBHAM

AKASH

RUPAK

MALLORY

Oh my god Wrehan is bleeding!
Someone call 911!
ARYAN

Surname Whitaker hai Whitaker.

WREHAN
Mereko kuch hua nahi hai chhod

VEDANT

59.
RUPAK
Chhodne bolra... ek tapli maarega
idhar tapak jaaega.
AKASH
Waise bhi half murder ke case me
tereko andar daalne hi waala me.
SHUBHAM
Half kayko full karne de na! hagrat
ko bas taadne ko aata hai aur kuch
nahi.
WREHAN
Jaise Alicia mereko taad rahi thi
waise?
Everybody goes silent. Alicia now is sure ki Wrehan is going
to die for what he has said.
SHUBHAM
Kya bola tu?
WREHAN
Repeat karna padega? Ek baar me
dimaag register nahi kar paata hai?
SHUBHAM LEAPS OUT AND STARTS BEATING WREHAN AGAIN. THIS
TIME, WREHAN RETALIATES WITH SOME FORCE BUT ISN'T REALLY
DAMAGING SHUBHAM. AT THIS VERY MOMENT, SUHANI SHOUTS.
SUHANI
BAS!
They all look at her, and stop fighting.
SUHANI
Birthday party hai na ye?! Kuch
decency hai tum sabko? Kya kar rahe
ho iska kuch sense hi nahi hai! Wo
Karan ko kaisa lagra rahega samjho
na zara. Ya uski koi kadar hi nahi?
VASU
Aae tu toh bolegi hi na. Tera coji
coji time jo waste hora hai.
AKASH
Aae limit me reh samjha na?
ARYAN
Aae chup karo yaar tum sab! Jo
lafde karne ke hain, wo sab neeche
jaake karo.
(MORE) 
60.
ARYAN (CONT'D) 
Ye ghar ka kuch bhi toota na, me
bahut maarega tum sabko.
WREHAN
Ha chal neeche.
SHUBHAM
Dum tho dekh nangu pangu me.
ALICIA
Shubham please don't do this. Me
beg karri tujhe.
SHUBHAM
Ha bhikari hai tho bheek mangegi hi
na...
WREHAN
Zara baat kam kar aur neeche chal.
Dekhte kya karta hai tu.
HARD CUT TO:
26.INT. LIFT. NIGHT.                                     26
A random guy is standing inside the lift humming to the lift
music playing. He is smiling.  He is alone. He is happy.
The lift stops, and he is startled to see a lot of people
trying to get in. They step inside and manhandle him,
ultimately removing him from the lift to accomodate
themselves properly.
Everyone is in the lift together, not moving. They have that
tension between them but everyone is still. Lift music is
the only thing we hear. They all get out.
27.EXT. PARKING. NIGHT.                                  27
Everybody walks in a cliched film slo mo, and look cool yet
funny. A tune similar to "Hell of a Life" plays in the
background. (to be shot in highest frame rate possible)
They arrange themselves in teams of 3, with Aryan and Karan
standing in the middle of the frame. They do not know what
to do.
Both Wrehan and Shubham glance at each other.
WREHAN
(to Vedant)
Kidar hai wo?
61.
VEDANT
Pahuch raha hai. You don't worry.
We see 3 of them now from the back of shubham's hand. A
knife slipsout of his sleeve, right into his hand.
KARAN
Shubham mujhe samajh raha hai tu
bhadka hai but zara control kar.
Iska result soch kya hoga.
SHUBHAM
Ye sab is chhipkali ko samajhna
chahiye tha.
KARAN
Abhi wo yeda hai toh apan kya kar
sakte hain?
SHUBHAM
Dhopat sakte.
KARAN
Tu bhi nahi samajhra. Ab me kya
karu?!
SHUBHAM
Gap chup baju me jaake khada reh.
Tereko birthday gift dera me.
At this moment he drops the knife so that it is visible to
all. Aryan is scared shitless, but Wrehan doesn't seem to be
affected.
We get a close up of how furious Shubham is.
Just as he is about to attack Wrehan, a guy wearing goggles
and hearing music enters the parking on a motorcycle. he is
carrying a laptop bag, hanging around his neck. He stops
exactly near Wrehan.
 GUY
Bol. Kidar hai wo?
RUPAK
Isko kidar tho dekha hai.
WREHAN
Ye kya saamne khada hai.
GUY
Wo beech waala ya phir sab?
62.
WREHAN
Jo man kare.
RUPAK
Abbe ye Fernandez hai!
GUY
Theek hai.
Fernandez takes out a machine gun out of the laptop bag,
loads it. Shubham, Rupak and Vasu start running so that he
cannot have a clear shot. Fernandez still doesn't aim his
gun at them.
WREHAN
Kya kar raha hai?!!
FERNANDEZ
Gaana change karra re ruk.
WREHAN
Wo log nikal jaaenge!
FERNANDEZ
Koi nahi nikalta.
Fernandez starts shooting random shots. They are all hiding
behind poles and things that they can find. Shubham and Vasu
hide together or near each other, while Karan and Aryan find
shelter together.
SHUBHAM
Isko fernandez kaise mila?!
VASU
Wo vedant jugaad lagaya rahega kuch
toh! Bhai pura wat laga dega ye tho
apni!
KARAN
(to aryan)
Ho gayi shaanti?! Saala birthday pe
mar jaunga me!
ARYAN
Idhar goli chalra phir bhi mere pe
daalra sab tu?!
The shots stop. The gun is empty. He carries on to fill
another cartridge. All of them go silent for a moment, and
then come to realise what had just happened.

63.
 SHUBHAM
(miming)
Kya hua?
VASU
(miming)
Kya pata.
Same happens with Karan and Aryan.
WREHAN
Kya?
Fernandez doesn't hear him, and keeps on loading the gun.
WREHAN
Jaldi bhai.
Fernandez looks at him pissed, and Wrehan gets the signal to
shut up.
CUT TO:
28.INT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                    28
Suhani goes to a washroom in the house. She washes up
properly, and then  notices something. She moves closer
towards the toilet, and is shaken to death. She is just
about to scream and -
 CUT TO:
27A.EXT. PARKING. NIGHT.                                 27A
Karan gets a call, he picks it up. Fernandez is still
loading his gun. He answers and goes into shock. He just
gets up from where he is hiding, and stands right in the
visibility of Fernandez. he is still holding his phone to
his ear.
FERNANDEZ
kya?
They all look at Karan. He is just about to cry. Fernandez
looks at Wrehan to confirm if he should shoot Karan or not.
Wrehan asks him to stop. Fernandez stops shooting altogether
because of the confusion of what Karan is doing. We get a
close up of Karan and then-
CUT TO:
64.
29.INT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                   29
Everyone is gathered around, including Fernandez. They all
look scared. Some of them are panicking and moving towards
the toilet, or are just standing still, not moving even an
inch of their body.
Lying down on the floor, there is a body of a girl. Blood is
or was flowing out from her left wrist. It has for sure
become late to act or do anything. She has of course,
committed suicide. The girl we see is Niharika Malhotra.
People either approach the body, or they leave the room. We
get a close up of Karan again. he realises about the gift
she had given him. the beeping device.
 He removes it from his pocket to find that is has stopped
beeping. No light or sound from it.
EXTREME CU. High frequency sounds around Karan intensify. He
goes into a deep state of shock, and that leads us to-
MATCH CUT TO:
2F.INT. PSY ROOM. DAY.                                    2F
Karan is sitting there on the chair. We are back in the
present. We see dr. Anjali. After a moment of no one
talking, she speaks.
DR. ANJALI
So the device just switched off.
KARAN
(voice breaking)
Yes.
DR. ANJALI
Just like that?
KARAN
Yes.
DR. ANJALI
Wo machine hai kaha?
Karan whips out his keychain and shows the device to dr.
Anjali. She looks at it, gives it back to him. He keeps it
on a table nearby, and buries his head in his hands.

65.
DR. ANJALI
What happened to the gun guy?
KARAN
Fernandez?
DR. ANJALI
Ha.
KARAN
Wo rubber bullet marra tha. Sabko
baadme pata chala ki uska boss usko
khudse kabhi original bullet deta
hi nahi tha kyuki wo aisa bina
soche samjhe kisi ko bhi thok deta
tha.
DR. ANJALI
No police case against him then?
KARAN
Kaha police complaint. 2 piece cake
khaake gaya wo.
DR. ANJALI
Wow.
KARAN
Uske jaise logo ki wajah se kitne
log suffer karte hain, ye ginne
layak bhi nahi hai.
DR. ANJALI
Fernandez ke saath legal actions
hone chahiye.
KARAN
Uski baat nahi karra me.
DR. ANJALI
Fir?
KARAN
Niharika.
DR. ANJALI
You feel like you are the one to
blame for her death just like you
thought when your mom passed away.
Karan with his head still buried in his hands, starts
sobbing. Dr. Anjali passes the tissues towards him but does
not console him.

66.
KARAN
Maine kabhi kisi ka kuch bura nahi
kiya hai. Par har baar meri wajah
se kuch na kuch galat ho hi jaata
hai.
DR. ANJALI
Aisa nahi hai Karan. We have talked
about what happened with your
mother. it was a car accident.
Nothing more, nothing less.
KARAN
Toh Niharika ka kya ha?! Me khudh
meri aankho se usko udhar dekha
tha. Dead. Saas nahi leri thi wo.
Wo feeling samajh aa rahi hai? Usko
10 minute pehle maine dekha tha,
talking. Zinda. Aur ab? Heartbeat
band.
DR. ANJALI
Tumne hi bola hai ki wo mentally
unstable thi. She had problems. You
couldn't have prevented her from
doing it in any way!
KARAN
(pause)
Bacha sakta tha.
Anjali stares at Karan, and we go back into the party.
SHOTS OF KARAN EXPLAINING ALL OF THIS TO THE THERAPIST TO BE
INSERTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTAGE.
30.INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT                                   30
Niharika is drinking something, and Akash approaches her
from behind and starts a conversation. Niharika doesn't want
to be a part of this, but he insists on talking.
She tries to move but he gets physical. He grabs on to her
waist and doesn't let go for a while. Niharika gets so
disgusted in the end that she moves away slowly, acting as
if she is not trying to resist.
At this moment, Aryan enters the kitchen and Akash lets go
of Niharika. He has to go with Aryan back to the hall.
Niharika thinks of only one thing: talking to Karan.

67.
31.INT. ROOM 2. NIGHT.                                   31
Niharika gets Karan in a corner, and tells him what has
happened. The gestures are enough to understand what she is
saying. She wants Karan to help her out. He promises to get
Akash what he deserved, and leaves. Niharika feels assured
that Karan is going to help her.
32.INT. HALL. NIGHT.                                     32
Niharika goes out to see what Karan has done about Akash. To
her devastating shock, she sees Karan laughing and cracking
jokes with Akash, and seeming to have a good time with him.
This hurts her so much that she does not even attend the
party after that. The only time she comes out is when
Mallory is wasted.
In the end, with grief of her only friend not helping her
most gruesome experience, she slits her wrist with a razor.
2G.INT. PSY ROOM. DAY.                                   2G
The doctor is in shock. Even she does not know what to say.
KARAN
(voice cracking)
Me bacha sakta tha.
DR. ANJALI
Karan ye sab tum apne mann me kabse
leke baithe ho?
KARAN
(starts crying)
Wo aayi thi mere paas. Me bacha
sakta tha usko. Me bas ek baar bol
deta Akash ko, bas ek baar... ye
kuch nahi hota tha. Vo zinda hoti
abhi.
(BEAT)
Use waha pade hue dekha maine. Uss
din se har raat me ye bina soche
nahi so paya hu ki Niharika ne
mujhe apni heartbeat de di, aur me
kuch nahi kar paya. I 'chose' not
do anything.
DR. ANJALI
You seriously think that the
machine is real? Ki usme uski
heartbeat thi?
KARAN
Tho Aapko lagta hai wo jhoot hai?
68.
DR. ANJALI
(she sighs)
I did not say that.
KARAN
Tho aur kya bolna chahti ho? Mere
dimaag me kuch problem hai?
DR. ANJALI
Again. I did not say that.
KARAN
No this is exactly what you
therapists do. Pehle pura sunke le
lete ho, aur uske baad judgmental
opinions pass karte ho. Saamne
waale ke dimaag me kya chal raha
hai wo jaanedo, pehle apna opinion
jhado.
DR. ANJALI
Karan understand what I am trying
to say.
KARAN
Kya understand? Ye achha hai. Pehle
bas khudko jo sahi lagta hai wo
bolte jaana hai, aur uske baad agar
saamne waala bole ki nahi that is
not what is happening, tho use hi
pagal bol deneka.
DR. ANJALI
Try to understand ki ye sab bas
teri imagination hai. Nothing more,
nothing less. When people are in
grief, they tend to make up stuff
to make them feel better about
themselves. This heartbeat device
is a textbook example.
KARAN
Itna sab kuch batane ke baad bhi
aapko lagta hai ki me jhoot bol
raha hu?
DR. ANJALI
I just said i am not saying that.
69.
KARAN
Ye machine baj rahi thi! Beep kar
rahi thi! Mene khud dekha hai. Jab
phone aaya uske thode time pehle hi
ye band ho gayi thi. Mujhe baad me
realise hua.
DR. ANJALI
For the sake of argument lets say
ye sab sach hai.
KARAN
Hai.
DR. ANJALI
Aise bahut saare devices hote hain.
It basically is a toy that shoots
out lasers and makes a sound. Maybe
the battery died and it stopped.
KARAN
You are not ready to accept ki ye
sab hona coincidence nahi tha. usne
mujhpar trust kiya. Usne mujhe apna
sabse kareeb ka dost samjha aur
maine uski madat nahi ki. Ye sab
coincidence nahi tha.
This single thought keeps on
haunting me. aur sabse badi cheez
kya hai pata hai? Usse ab ye kabhi
bhi nahi pata chalega ki how much i
actually cared for her. Wo yahi
soch ke chali gayi ki me ek aur
waisa hi aadmi hu jise uske sab
harkate weird aur creepy lagte the.
 DR. ANJALI
But isnt it true ki now you have
that realization ki tumne jo kiya
wo bas galti se kiya. You did not
mean all of this to happen. You did
not mean to not help her.
KARAN
Par ab time chala gaya. Kuch nahi
kar sakta me.
DR. ANJALI
Karan listen to me. Tumhe uski
guilt hai.
(MORE) 
70.
DR. ANJALI (CONT'D) 
You are still in that guilt that
you could not, or did not help her
even after knowing for a fact ki
she asked you for your help. People
always tend to blame themselves
when something like this happens.
But there is nothing that we can do
about it now. What has happened
happened. We have to learn to move
on and continue with our lives.
KARAN
Ek minute ek minute. Matlab ye jo
cheez hui, use me bas bhool jau??
Just like that? I should pretend ki
ye sab kabhi hua hi nahi, and agar
hua bhi tho it was not a big deal.
Aisa sochu? Ye advice tho mujhe
Aryan bhi de deta tha.
DR. ANJALI
You cannot forget something this
big. Mujhe pata hai ki is cheez ka
trauma ek session me nahi jaane
waala. Tum ek seating me convince
nahi hone waale and agar ho jaate
tho mujhe pata chal jaata ki tumhe
kabhi regret tha hi nahi.
(con't)
But ye baat sach hai ki tumhe jitni
abhi regret hai, tumhe abhi jitni
takleef ho rahi hai, wo genuine
hai. And you know karan, that is
the best part about all of that has
happened.
KARAN
Kya?
DR. ANJALI
Normally agar tumhe uski koi kadar
nahi hoti ya phir you didn't really
care about her, even after what
happened, tho tum me aur baaki logo
me koi farak nahi hota tha. You
would've been just another ordinary
guy. But you understood your fault.
Tumhe samajh gaya ki jo hua wo
achha nahi hua. That realization is
all that is required. Ab tum past
change nahi kar paaoge but atleast
wo mistakes repeat nahi karoge.

71.
KARAN
But jo mistake ho gayi hai uska kya
karu me? Niharika jaisa aur koi
nahi hai mere paas. She was the
only one. And now ye mat bolna ki
agar itni close thi tho why didn't
I help her. Even I don't have an
answer to that.
(pause)
And what is this one session se
nahi hoga thing? Mujhe pata hai wo.
There was no need to specify
something so obvious.
DR. ANJALI
We all make mistakes.
KARAN
Ha then i am paying prices for
those mistakes.
DR. ANJALI
You don't have to Karan.
KARAN
Ye aapke liye bolna easy hai. Try
and be on this side of the room
once. Ek baar idhar baitho and kisi
random aadmi ko ya aurat ko apni
sabse intimate cheez batake dekho.
See how it feels.
DR Anjali does not speak this time. She just sighs, and
stares towards Karan.
KARAN
Ya ab ye silent treatment. You
might be the first therapist to
give their patients a silent
treatment.
DR. ANJALI
You get offended if i speak
anything.
KARAN
Kyuki aap offend kar rahe ho! What
do you mean move on?! Ye break up
nahi hai. We are talking about
death here.
DR. ANJALI
And i did talk about death when you
used to be here regarding your mom.
(MORE) 
72.
DR. ANJALI (CONT'D) 
I am no stranger to you karan. I
know you and i know what you feel.
(BEAT)
Niharika was mentally disturbed
from the beginning. The party
incident was just the tipping
point. What happened was
horrifying. We cannot deny that.
But tumhe jo regret ho raha hai, of
not being able to save her when you
had a chance to, is showing me how
much sorry you are.
KARAN
But Niharika ko kabhi nahi pata
chalega.
DR. ANJALI
You say the machine is real right?
KARAN
Yes.
DR. ANJALI
So if you believe that, tumhe ye
bhi believe karna hi padega ki the
amount of guilt you are in, has
already made a difference.
Realization is what was needed, and
you have it Karan.
Karan looks unconvinced. He looks at the doc, but he doesn't
say anything. He has lost all his points. He is either
beyond the point of convincing or he is just to tired to
speak.
Finally, the doctor speaks.
DR. ANJALI
You know what... lets stop today.
It has been a rough one for you.
She picks up the notepad kept on the table and starts
writing something.
DR. ANJALI
This is prozac what i am writing
down for you. Ise morning me lena,
you will feel quite better.
Karan still does not speak. He gets up, and takes the paper
from Dr. Anjali. He turns his back towards her to leave the
room.

73.
Before he leaves, he takes a quick look around the room,
just like he did in the very beginning.
He then looks at the Beeping device, Niharika's heartbeat
tied to his keychain. He stares at it a for quite a time.
He takes a deep breath, looks back towards the doctor.
KARAN
Thank you.
He turns again to pick up the keychain. Just as he is about
to pick it up, THE MACHINE BEEPS ONE LAST TIME.
CUT TO BLACK.
 THE END.
